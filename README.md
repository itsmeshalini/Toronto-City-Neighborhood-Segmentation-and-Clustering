### Background and Description:-
 This project requires to explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.the neighborhood data is not readily available on 
 the internet,which makes this project interesting and challenging in its unique way.
 For the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. 
 this project is  required to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a
 structured format in pandas data frame.
 Once the data is in a structured format,we can explore and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.
we leverage leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare and group the near by venues in the  neighborhoods city of Toronto .
